# About Stoned

**Stoned** is a DLC unlocker for games that **misuse** **Steamworks** for DLC validation.

> ⚠️ **Important:**
> - This tool does **not** download or install any DLC content. Instead, it unlocks DLC that is **already present** on your system but gated behind a purchase check. As a result, it **will not work** for games that require downloading additional DLC content after purchase (common in many single-player titles).
> - Most **multiplayer games**, where DLC is included locally but locked behind validation, **are supported**.
> - Games with **anti-cheat systems will not work** and may cause bans.
